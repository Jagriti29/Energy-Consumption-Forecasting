# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting
This project is a Streamlit-based web app that predicts energy consumption using weather parameters like humidity, wind speed, and month. It uses a trained machine learning model, fetches real-time weather data via an API, estimates electricity costs, and allows users to download prediction reports.
